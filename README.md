## Task 1
Functions for singly linked list:
- function that implements the reversal of a singly linked list, modifying references between nodes,
- sorting algorithm for a singly linked list - merge sort.
- function that merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.

## Task 2
Program that uses recursion to create the "Pythagorean Tree" fractal. The program visualize the "Pythagorean Tree" fractal, and the user can specify the recursion level.

## Task 3
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph using a binary heap for optimization.

## Task 4
Program for visualization the binary heap.

## Task 5
Program that visualizes tree traversals in-depth and breadth-first for the binary heap.

## Task 6
Program that uses two approaches â€” greedy algorithm and dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem of choosing food with the highest total calorie content within a limited budget:
- greedy algorithm maximizes the ratio of calories to cost without exceeding the specified budget,
- dynamic programming algorithm maximizes calorie content within a given budget.

## Task 7
Simulation where two dice are thrown a large number of times. For each throw, the sum of the numbers that appeared on both dice was determined. Using Monte Carlo method the calculation of the probability of each sum was done:
- the probabilities calculated using the Monte Carlo method are close to the theoretical ones,
- we can see the tendency that the sums in the middle have a higher probability than those at the extremes.
